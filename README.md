Simple Linear regression model built using Delhi climate data.
The notebook includes the Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing.
Data is split using Time Series cross validation technique.
Evaluation Metric: RMSEi is used. RMSLE(L for log) would not be required as there are no much outliers. Mean Absolute percentage /Mean Absolute Scale Error would not be applicable as we are not comparing 2 time series data on same model.
Finally, Linear regression model is used in predicting the time series.
